# flownorms
implementation of automated and data-driven normalization techniques for flow cytometry data

# Installation
## Dependencies
- R >= 4.5.1
- cyCombine
- flowCore

# Usage

The tool can be run on an input directory and normalize each of the files within according to given inputs. The following input was used to generate the validation dataset in version 0.1:

`Rscript cycombine/cycombine.r --input validation/dataset --output validation/cycombine_output --method scale --cofactor 5`

## Options

# Project Status & Roadmap

STATUS: early prototype! largely nonfunctional

## Long-term Goals
- provide standardized CLI inputs to use various normalization techniques for flow cytometry data
- benchmark normalization techniques on validation datasets with clear metrics
- provide a highly reproducible workflow for using normalization
